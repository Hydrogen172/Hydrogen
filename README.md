# Usage (MUST READ THIS)

<br> 
   https://hydrogen172.github.io/Hydrogen/
<br>
   There are 2 options to open Hydrogen with:
<br>
   about:blank cloaks with an about:blank URL
<br>
   blob:https opens with a blob:https followed by a temporary URL (this is not cloaked)
   <br>
3. clicking any of them will lead to a 404 page. **THIS IS A FAKE 404 PAGE**
   <br>
4. type anywhere on the screen "404pnf" and click right shift. If it doesn't work, you typoed or started typing too early.
   Think of it as an invisible text box
