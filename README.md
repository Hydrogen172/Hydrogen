# Usage (MUST READ THIS)

   Or choose one from below:
   https://gohydrogen.pages.dev/ (recommended)
   https://gohydrogen.glitch.me/
   https://hydrogen172.github.io/Hydrogen/

   There are 2 options to open Hydrogen with:
   about:blank cloaks with an about:blank URL
   blob:https opens with a blob:https followed by a temporary URL (this is not cloaked)
2. clicking any of them will lead to a 404 page. **THIS IS A FAKE 404 PAGE**
4. type anywhere on the screen "404pnf" and click right shift. If it doesn't work, you typoed or started typing too early.
   Think of it as an invisible text box
